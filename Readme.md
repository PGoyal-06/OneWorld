This is my Hackathon Project for @NorCalHacks. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to design the website properly but I did what I could with the limited time I had. I hope you like it!

The Website focuses on the global issue of lack of education and discusses the causes and possible solutions for it.

Made using HTML, JS, and CSS.
