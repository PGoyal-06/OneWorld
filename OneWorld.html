                <p>
                    Lack of education refers to a situation where individuals or communities do not have access to or do not receive
                    adequate formal or informal learning opportunities.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li style="width: 50%;">
                <p>
                    It is characterized by a limited or complete absence of schooling, training, or instruction, leading to a lack of
                    knowledge, skills, and intellectual development.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li style="width: 50%;">
                <p>
                    Lack of education can occur due to various factors such as poverty, cultural barriers, social norms, gender inequality,
                    armed conflicts, and inadequate infrastructure.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li style="width: 50%;">
                <p>
                    It can have detrimental effects on individuals and societies, hindering personal development, economic growth, and
                    social progress.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li style="width: 50%;">
                <p>
                    Individuals with limited education may face difficulties in finding employment or achieving higher income levels,
                    leading to a perpetuation of poverty and socio-economic inequalities.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li style="width: 50%;">
                <p>
                    Lack of education can contribute to the persistence of illiteracy, preventing individuals from fully participating in
                    civic activities, making informed decisions, and exercising their rights.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li style="width: 50%;">
                <p>
                    It can impede access to healthcare and information, increasing vulnerability to health issues, including preventable
                    diseases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lack of education can also limit critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and creativity, hindering innovation and
                    societal advancement.

                        <p>
                            Global illiteracy rates: According to UNESCO, as of 2021, approximately 773 million adults worldwide
                            (aged 15 and above)
                            lack basic literacy skills, with two-thirds of them being women.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            Out-of-school children: The number of out-of-school children varies over time and across regions. As of
                            2021, it was
                            estimated that around 258 million children and youth were out of school. Sub-Saharan Africa and South
                            Asia have the
                            highest number of out-of-school children.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Gender disparities: Gender inequality in education remains a significant issue in many parts of the
                            world. In some
                            regions, girls are more likely to be denied access to education compared to boys. For example, in
                            sub-Saharan Africa,
                            around 9 million girls of primary school age will never attend school.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Primary school completion rates: According to the Global Education Monitoring Report, around 83% of
                            children worldwide
                            completed primary school in 2020. However, this still leaves a significant number of children without
                            completing their
                            primary education.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            Disparities in secondary education: Secondary education enrollment rates vary across countries. In
                            low-income countries,
                            the gross enrollment rate in secondary education is around 45%, compared to 90% in high-income
                            countries.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            Education and poverty: Lack of education is closely linked to poverty. It is estimated that each
                            additional year of
                            schooling can increase a person's earning potential by 10%. Education plays a vital role in breaking the
                            cycle of
                            poverty and improving livelihoods.
