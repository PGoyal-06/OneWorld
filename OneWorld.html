                    Lack of education refers to a situation where individuals or communities do not have access to or do not receive
                    adequate formal or informal learning opportunities.

                    It is characterized by a limited or complete absence of schooling, training, or instruction, leading to a lack of
                    knowledge, skills, and intellectual development.

                <p>
                    Lack of education can occur due to various factors such as poverty, cultural barriers, social norms, gender inequality,
                    armed conflicts, and inadequate infrastructure.
                </p>

                    Individuals with limited education may face difficulties in finding employment or achieving higher income levels,
                    leading to a perpetuation of poverty and socio-economic inequalities.

                <p>
                    Lack of education can contribute to the persistence of illiteracy, preventing individuals from fully participating in
                    civic activities, making informed decisions, and exercising their rights.

                    It can impede access to healthcare and information, increasing vulnerability to health issues, including preventable

                            Global illiteracy rates: According to UNESCO, as of 2021, approximately 773 million adults worldwide (aged 15 and above)
                            lack basic literacy skills, with two-thirds of them being women.

                            Out-of-school children: The number of out-of-school children varies over time and across regions. As of 2021, it was
                            estimated that around 258 million children and youth were out of school. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have the
                            highest number of out-of-school children.

                            Gender disparities: Gender inequality in education remains a significant issue in many parts of the world. In some
                            regions, girls are more likely to be denied access to education compared to boys. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa,
                            around 9 million girls of primary school age will never attend school.
                        </p>

                            Primary school completion rates: According to the Global Education Monitoring Report, around 83% of children worldwide
                            completed primary school in 2020. However, this still leaves a significant number of children without completing their
                            primary education.

                            Disparities in secondary education: Secondary education enrollment rates vary across countries. In low-income countries,
                            the gross enrollment rate in secondary education is around 45%, compared to 90% in high-income countries.

                            Education and poverty: Lack of education is closely linked to poverty. It is estimated that each additional year of
                            schooling can increase a person's earning potential by 10%. Education plays a vital role in breaking the cycle of
                            poverty and improving livelihoods.
